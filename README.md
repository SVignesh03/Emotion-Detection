# Emotion-Detection
This is my first project and I didn't even know that it is runnung properly or not but I'm sure that it is more than 70% working. If anyone modify and make the code better kindly ping me that I can improve myself. This project is not 100% coded by me it also contain some opensource codes(templates)
# Requiements

# Needed Modules

* flask (pip install flask)
* camera (pip install camera)
* opencv (pip install opencv)
* numpy (pip install numpy)
* fer (pip install fer)
* moviepy (pip install moviepy)

# About the Project

The main motive of this project is to access the web cam and to detect the person's emotion who is infront of the camera
The common emotions are
* Angry
* Disguest
* Panic (fear)
* Happy 
* Sad
* Neutral

The project will show the percentage of the above mentioned emotions
We can also print the emotion having highest percentage

# Issues I faced
The main issue I faced is that my PC doesn't have a web cam. So, I used DroidCam as a alternative, but it results in slower execution. That is the program is running but the video has a lag.

# My Recommendation
My recommendation is to use a Web Cam for better experience. Tensorflow is a big module and some system finds difficult to run this module, if you face this issue kindly use jupiter notebook from browser
